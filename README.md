Eatsy: Comprehensive Campus Food Delivery, Table Reservations, and Event Ticketing
A web-based platform designed to simplify campus life by providing students access to food delivery, table reservations, and event ticket bookings directly from their hostel rooms. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Eatsy is tailored for large campuses where mobility restrictions limit students' access to dining options. This project leverages a user-friendly interface and responsive design to bring convenience to campus communities.
